        <p>Some people call me <em>Nat</em><br> Having a nickname is <strong>fun</strong>, <br> More fun than having a <em>cat</em> <br> I think I would be <strong>done</strong> </p>
        <p>But can having a pet be that <em>bad?</em> <br> I think my roommate and I could <strong>share</strong> <br> She might get <em>mad</em> <br> I wonder what she could <strong>bare</strong></p>
        <p> Her name is <em>Soph</em> <br> Again, mine is <strong>Nat</strong> <br> She's good at making <em>loafs</em> <br> And I am good at swinging a <strong>bat</strong></p>
